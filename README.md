# Transport of Perishable Goods 

Creating a web application based on what I have studied at University of East Sarajevo - Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

## Utilisation

Using this Web Application, you can calculate how much of Dry Ice, (Water) Ice & Liquid Nitrogen will be needed for transporting (perishable) goods during the year.

To use this app, you need to know Serbian language (or Serbo-Croatian language, if you are born in former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).

## Built With
This project assignment is created by [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs) and it uses [jsDelivr](https://github.com/jsdelivr) CDN servers.
